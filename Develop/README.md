# README.md Generator
We were tasked with with creating an application to generate README.md files. 

## Purpose
This application will help with quickly creating README files for projects and linking to the user's Github profile. THe code asks the user a series of questions about their Github profile and about the project that they are creating the README for. After that, it generates the README file using the responses to the questoions as well as information that was received about the users Github profile. 

## Technologies
Used Javascript and Node for the files. 

## How to Use
Download files and run in terminal

## Credits
This was compiled using a variety of sources. I reviewed the exercises from the class. I also used the Node documentation. I had a lot of help from tutoring sessions, Kunbile, my tutor,  helped with the syntax for the functions and getting the README to generate. I also 'met' with my classmates, Jee, Ray, and Rachel to help with other issues.
